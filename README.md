# Landing Page

This project is a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed changes the background. Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item scrolls you to the appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
